**üèó HTML (Structure)**

In my project, HTML is used to define the elements of the slider:
The container that holds everything (.container)
The slider wrapper that contains images and navigation buttons
The images themselves (.image-item)
The buttons (#prev-slide, #next-slide)
The scrollbar and its thumb.
üé®** CSS (Design/Style)
****JavaScript (Functionality/Logic)**

In your project, JavaScript makes the slider interactive:
Scrolls images when clicking Next / Previous buttons
Hides the buttons when at the start or end
Updates the scrollbar thumb position while scrolling
Allows dragging the scrollbar thumb to move images
Adjusts scrollbar thumb size when resizing the window
In my project, CSS is used to make the slider look nice:
Layout (flex, gap, scroll-behavior)
Styling images (size, rounded corners)
Styling navigation buttons (position, background, hover effect)
Creating a custom scrollbar with a draggable thumb.
